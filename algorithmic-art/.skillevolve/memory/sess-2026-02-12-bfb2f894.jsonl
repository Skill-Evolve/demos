{"time": "2026-02-12T21:50:47-05:00", "type": "technique", "note": "Spatial grid hashing for O(n) neighbor queries in particle evolution system — critical for smooth 60fps with 800+ agents. Grid cell size matches cluster radius."}
{"time": "2026-02-12T21:50:47-05:00", "type": "taste", "note": "Dark canvas (#0a0e14) with semi-transparent wash creates geological strata effect — trails never fully vanish, building palimpsest of evolutionary history. Cool-to-warm palette (steel blue → anthropic orange) encodes generational distance beautifully."}
{"time": "2026-02-12T21:50:47-05:00", "type": "decision", "note": "Evolution triggered by sustained spatial clustering rather than explicit fitness function — proximity and persistence ARE fitness. More emergent, more philosophically aligned with the concept of AI agents self-organizing."}
{"time": "2026-02-12T21:57:52-05:00", "type": "taste", "note": "Full-spectrum gen palette (indigo→cyan→mint→lime→gold→tangerine→magenta→violet) with per-agent hue shift of ±20 makes clusters feel alive rather than flat uniform color blocks. The randomness within order is key."}
{"time": "2026-02-12T21:57:52-05:00", "type": "technique", "note": "Hard agent cap (600) + reduced respawn rate (10 per cycle, every 90 frames) keeps memory stable on any machine. Canvas at 800x800 instead of 1200x1200 cuts pixel fill by 56%. Single glow pass instead of layered glow saves a circle() call per evolved agent per frame."}
{"time": "2026-02-12T21:57:52-05:00", "type": "gotcha", "note": "With animated particle systems, agent arrays grow unbounded if you only append and never prune. Must periodically filter dead agents AND cap total population — both spawns from evolution events and edge respawns need the cap check."}
{"time": "2026-02-12T21:57:52-05:00", "type": "recipe", "note": "Philosophy-first workflow for algorithmic art: 1) Write 4-6 paragraph manifesto naming the movement and its computational principles 2) Deduce the conceptual seed (subtle reference woven into parameters) 3) Implement from the template viewer.html keeping fixed UI, replacing only algorithm+params 4) Tune for performance last. The philosophy prevents generic output."}
{"time": "2026-02-12T21:57:52-05:00", "type": "reflection", "note": "The algorithmic-art skill workflow of philosophy→code is genuinely effective. Writing the manifesto first forced clear thinking about what the system should express, which made implementation decisions obvious rather than arbitrary. Would recommend this approach for any generative art project."}
